# RAG_Fintech_HR_Project

This is an AI Chatbot for a startup to help employees get answers faster to questions the will likely as HR. A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) project which draws responses from a curated internal knowledge base of employee handbook, HR policy document, vetted Slack conversations, FAQ docs which can be updated.



Instead of digging through different pages for answers, just prompt the company's knowledge-base chatbot. Now the HR team can focus on more productive tasks while employees get clarity faster.



This was a hands-on project to explore LLMs and build a robust information retrieval system from scratch.
